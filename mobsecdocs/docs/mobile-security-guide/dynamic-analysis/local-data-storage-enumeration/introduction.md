In order to enumerate the file structure of an installed application, we need to have access to a
real or emulated device. This could be achieved by using the [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) (ADB),
a command-line tool that lets you communicate directly with the device. Using ADB, we can
install and debug applications, while the Unix shell it provides can be used to run commands
on the device.
